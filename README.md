Solve the problems using Python

1. Write a python program to predict income levels of adult individuals using a linear regression model. The process includes training, testing and evaluating the model on the Adult dataset. In this sample experiment you need to train a classifier on the Adult dataset, to predict whether an individual’s income is greater or less than $50,000. The students are expected to demonstrate how you can perform basic data processing operations, split the dataset into training and test sets, train the model, score the test dataset, and evaluate the predictions.

2. Write a python code to cluster similar companies into same group given their Wikipedia articles and can be used to assign cluster to new company. The students are expected to demonstrate how to use the K-Means clustering algorithm to perform segmentation on companies from the Standard & Poor (S&P) 500 index, based on the text of Wikipedia articles about each company.
